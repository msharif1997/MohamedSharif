<h1>WDV2221 Intro Javascript</h1>
<h2>Unit-4 Assignment - Functions with Parameters </h2>
<h3>Directions:</h3>
<p>Problem 1</p>
<p>a. Create a global variable called schoolName. Assign it an initial value of &quot;Des Moines Area Community College&quot;.</p>
<p>b. Create a function called processString( ).</p>
<ul>
  <li>the function will accept one input parameter called inValue</li>
  <li>use the String.length property to display the number of characters to the console</li>
  <li>use the toUpperCase( ) to display the string in capital letters to the console</li>
  <li>display the first five letters of the string to the console</li>
</ul>

<p>c. Call this function using a button and the onclick event handler. Pass in the schoolName variable as the parameter.</p>
<p>Problem  2</p>
<p>a. Create two global variables. One called name1 and assign it a value of &quot;Mary&quot;. The other called name2 and assign it a value of &quot;Smith&quot;.</p>
<p>b.  Create a function called printName( ).</p>
<ul>
  <li>the function will accept two parameters, firstName and lastName.</li>
  <li>concatenate the names into a single string formatted as "firstName lastName" and display the result to the document</li>
  <li>concatenate the names into a single string formatted as "lastName, firstName" and display the result to the document</li>
  <li>concatenate the names into a single string formatted as "lastName(all capitals), firstName" and display the result to the document</li>
</ul>
<script>
  function printName(){
    var upperCaseLName = name2.toUpperCase(name1, name2);
    document.write("Your full name is: " + name1 + " " + name2 + "\n<br>");
    document.write("Your full name is: " + name2 + ", " + name1 + "\n<br>");
    document.write("Your full name is: " + upperCaseLName + ", " + name1 + "\n<br>");
  }
  printName();
</script>
<p>c. Call this function during runtime. Pass in the name1 and name2 variables as the parameters.</p>
<p>Problem  3 </p>
<p>a. Create a global variable called totalSales. Assign it a value of 3435.6. It should be numeric data type.</p>
<p>b. Use the provided currency formatting function to display totalSales formatted as currency in the following line. </p>
<h3>Your Total Sales: </h3>
<script>
   // fixedFormat.format(totalSales)
  document.write("<strong>Your Total Sales: </strong>" + fixedFormat.format(totalSales));
