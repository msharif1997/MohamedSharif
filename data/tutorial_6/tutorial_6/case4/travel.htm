<h2>Bula! Welcome to Fiji.</h2>
<p>Located in the heart of the South Pacific, Fiji is blessed with 333 tropical islands that are home to some of the happiest people on Earth.</p>

<p>Known for its luxurious private-islands, all-inclusive resorts, top spas, culinary destinations and outdoor adventures, Fiji is most widely celebrated for its culture, which uniquely welcomes visitors home.</p>

<p>Fiji's white sand beaches and pristine, crystal-clear ocean waters offer an ideal vacation destination for divers, honeymooners and families-- or simply, those looking to relax and get away from it all. 
Fiji is easily accessible through convenient, non-stop flights from Los Angeles, San Francisco or Honolulu aboard Fiji Airways.</p>

<h2>Welcome To Vietnam</h2>

<p>From colonial Hanoi and the karst scenery of Halong Bay, to the mercantile history of Hoi An, to fast-paced Saigon and the Mekong Delta, our Vietnam specialists use their personal experience of the country to plan your tailor-made tour of Vietnam in detail.</p>

<p>Travel in Vietnam is often based around a journey between Hanoi and Saigon, taking in the highlights of the central region between the two. Our Vietnam specialists can also suggest the country’s often overlooked, lesser-known sights and experiences, such as discovering brightly dressed hill tribe communities in the Tonkinese Alps or the remote markets of Ha Giang – places and people we’ve come to know over 20 years of research and return visits.</p>

<h2>Welcome To Iceland</h2>

<h3>The Big Picture</h3>
<p>Located in the North-Atlantic ocean close by the Arctic Circle, Iceland is very much a bridge between continents. It takes approximately five hours to fly from New York to Reykjavík, and three hours from London. Thanks to the Gulf Stream, Iceland enjoys a cool, temperate maritime climate, with refreshing summers and surprisingly mild temperatures in winter. Icelandic culture has been shaped by isolation and the extreme forces of nature. These conditions have created a resilient people, where family ties are close, the sense of tradition is strong, and the bond with nature is tight. Here you can learn about our unique little island.</p>
