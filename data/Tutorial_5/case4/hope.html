<h2>What we need to survive on another planet</h2>
<p>What we need for survival For humans to survive we need oxygen, therefore any planet which does not have oxygen would be unsuitable for us to live on. 
 We also need a supply of water. We need water for many reasons such as to grow food or for other animals. We also need things to eat so if a planet is not able to sustain animals and plants, it also would not be suitable for long-term survival.
 We need a certain amount of sunlight and we need a planet which is neither too hot or too cold. A planet with stable temperatures between 0C and 40C would be suitable. 
 We also need an atmosphere to shield off the harmful rays from the sun. Below the different planets in our solar system are considered whether they fulfil the basic requirements for life.

 <h3> Core Democratic Characteristics </h3>
 
 <ul>
     <li> Democracy is government in which power and civic responsibility are exercised by all adult citizens, directly, or through their freely elected representatives.
	 </li> 
     
	 <li>Democracy rests upon the principles of majority rule and individual rights. Democracies guard against all-powerful central governments and decentralize government to regional and local levels, understanding that all levels of government must be as accessible and responsive to the people as possible.
	 </li>
	 <li>Democracies understand that one of their prime functions is to protect such basic human rights as freedom of speech and religion; the right to equal protection under law; and the opportunity to organize and participate fully in the political, economic, and cultural life of society.
	 </li>
	 <li>Democracies conduct regular free and fair elections open to citizens of voting age.
	 </li>
	 <li>Citizens in a democracy have not only rights, but also the responsibility to participate in the political system that, in turn, protects their rights and freedoms.
	 </li>
	 <li>Democratic societies are committed to the values of tolerance, cooperation, and compromise. In the words of Mahatma Gandhi, "Intolerance is itself a form of violence and an obstacle to the growth of a true democratic spirit.
	 </li>

	 <h4> Majority Rule and Minority Rights </h4>
	 
	 <p>All democracies are systems in which citizens freely make political decisions by majority rule. In the words of American essayist E.B. White: "Democracy is the recurrent suspicion that more than half the people are right more than half the time.
        But majority rule, by itself, is not automatically democratic. No one, for example, would call a system fair or just that permitted 51 percent of the population to oppress the remaining 49 percent in the name of the majority.
        In a democratic society, majority rule must be coupled with guarantees of individual human rights that, in turn, serve to protect the rights of minorities and dissenters â€“ whether ethnic, religious, or simply the losers in political debate. 
        The rights of minorities do not depend upon the good will of the majority and cannot be eliminated by majority vote. The rights of minorities are protected because democratic laws and institutions protect the rights of all citizens
